# Interview Test

After the last sprint demo, we finally convinced the client to allocate some budget to implement a language-switcher. The backend developers told in the meeting that the existing api can have the language in the URI after "api/".
The visual- and UX designers added that a simple selectbox on the homepage will be enough, because this website act like a wizard, you start at the homepage, go to the overview page and end up at a detail page (a location of a store).
I think this should be easy and the team decided to do this.

Then they asked us about the possibilities of implementing a cookie bar as well, because this is required by law. The backenders ensured this should be a new component and the designers said a simply bar on the bottom will be enough. If you click on "I accept", this thing should not appear again.

But...

The client mentioned in the last meeting that they wanted this before the final deploy to production, what is very soon. Plus, the only frontend developer in our team has planned a nice vacation and will leave today. He told us that you could perhaps help us out.
